# FerroXYZ
Visualize and Edit XYZ files.
Currently using macroquad.rs for rendering.

## TODO
- [ ] Add criteria for drawing the bonds (only when distance < sum of kovalent radii)
- [ ] Make it possible to add or remove Atoms to/of the shown structure and save to a new XYZ file
- [ ] Add feature to automatically fill vacancies with hydrogen atoms
- [ ] Change to a different renderer (either more low level or more high level) to enable more configuration of the objects one can render

- [ ] Add geometry optimization with a force-field
- [ ] Compile for wasm
